# sample-sfsafariviewcontroller-chromecustomtabs

This sample app shows a simple usage of SFSafariViewController/Chrome Custom Tabs based on https://qiita.com/lucifuges/items/b17d602417a9a249689f . This app does **not** utilize the unity-webview plugin. The unity-webview plugin's various functions depend on UIWebView/WKWebView/WebView and cannot be covered by SFSafariViewController/Chrome Custom Tabs. I however made this app and put it here as SFSafariViewController/Chrome Custom Tabs can be more adequate for some applications and I cannot find any other simple sample code.
